# Group Project - Business Intelligence II (2025W)

## 1. Step By Step Instructions

- We wrote more details on this in the slides
- Mainly we tried to follow the README files in the original repositories


## 2. Necessary Code

- The paper had its code divided in two: **experiment 1** is found in repository [SSD - Steady-State Detection](https://gitlab.uni-mannheim.de/processanalytics/ssd) and **experiment 2** is found in repository [PGTNet4SSD](https://github.com/Keyvan-Amiri-Elyasi/PGTNet4SSD)

- For experiment 1, our modifications to the code are very limited, as such we added in this repo a zip folder with the results of the run

- For experiment 2, the code was changed in several places so that it can run without errors on our machine

## 3. System Information

- Experiment 1 was run on the PC mentioned on slide 5 from the presentation
- Experiment 2 was run on two PCs, mentioned on slide 11. Both runs gave the same results mentioned on slide 13
